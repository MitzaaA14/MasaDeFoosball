Foosball Table - AutoCAD Project

A comprehensive 3D modeling project of a complete foosball table created in AutoCAD, developed as part of a Computer-Aided Design course at the University of Bucharest.

📋 Project Overview:

This project presents a detailed 3D model of a foosball table at 1:2 scale, starting from 2D sketches and progressing to a complete three-dimensional representation. The table includes all functional components necessary for an authentic foosball gaming experience.

🎯 Key Components:

- Table frame with protective rounded edges
- Playing field with proper markings and dimensions
- 4 metal rods (goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, attackers) with handles
- 22 players (11 per team in red and blue)
- Goals with ball collection system
- Scoring system with bead counters (10 goals standard)
- Regulation soccer ball modeled with pentagon/hexagon pattern
- Support structures for rod stabilization
- Protective end caps for player safety

🛠️ Technical Details:

Software: AutoCAD
Scale: 1:2
Units: Centimeters with 4 decimal precision
Dimensions: 57cm × 30cm × 36cm (length × width × height)
